configure: error: The following required libraries were not found:
     libjpeg libgif/libungif libtiff gnutls
Maybe some development libraries/packages are missing?
If you don't want to link with them give
     --with-jpeg=no --with-gif=no --with-tiff=no --with-gnutls=no
as options to configure

./configure --prefix=/home/chengzhengqian/Application/emacs-28-lucid --with-x-toolkit=lucid
./configure --prefix=/home/chengzhengqian/Application/emacs-28-gtk --with-x-toolkit=gtk3

** The new configure option '--with-json' adds support for JSON using
the Jansson library.  It is on by default; use 'configure
--with-json=no' to build without Jansson support.  The new JSON
functions 'json-serialize', 'json-insert', 'json-parse-string', and
'json-parse-buffer' are typically much faster than their Lisp
counterparts from json.el.

note: one need to sudo apt install libjansson-dev on deb-based linux for this to work; also ./configure shows Does Emacs use -ljansson? yes if that was found)
